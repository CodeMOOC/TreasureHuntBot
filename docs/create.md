The *Code Hunting Games* bot has been designed to let users create their own games, either for “free play” or to participate in a large-scale multi-game event (such as the planned game for *CodeWeek 2017*).

# Overview for organizers

In this phase the game is invite-only: please check if organizers have sent you a link to create your own game.
If so, follow the link on a device where you have Telegram installed.
You will be automatically forwarded to the game creation process through the bot.

The bot will ask the following information:

1. You game’ name: in the case of *CodeWeek 2017*, we would suggest to use your local language and to mention CodeWeek somehow. In any case, you may pick whatever you like.
2. A *public Telegram channel* where the bot will automatically publish the progress of teams in your game. This is optional. [Read the Wiki for further information](https://github.com/CodeMOOC/TreasureHuntBot/wiki/Setting-up-a-public-channel).
3. An e-mail address at which we can reach you, just in case.
4. The starting location (i.e., where all teams will meet at the start of the game).
5. The ending location (i.e., where all teams will be sent at the end of the game).
6. A sequence of intermediate locations. Each location is composed of a geographical position and a name (which can be anything and will be only visible to you). All games have a minimum number of locations that are needed to setup the game.

*Note:* locations must be provided using the “share location” right in the Telegram conversation. Click on the *attachment* icon and tap on “location”.

Once you’re done, the bot will generate a ZIP package of QR Codes (in PDF).
You will then be able to print out the PDFs and hide the QR Codes at the actual physical locations you specified.

In the end, remember to **activate** the game by clicking on the “activate” button in your conversation with the bot. (QR Codes provided in your game package will not work until the game is activated.)

Have fun! ✌
