## How does it work?

*Code Hunting Games* offers an easy and accessible game experience, both for players and game administrators.
The game is played entirely through a text conversation between the players and the [@treasurehuntbot Telegram&nbsp;bot](https://t.me/treasurehuntbot).

*Code Hunting Games* play sessions can be organized freely by anybody.
Any number of players can participate to a game session: players will split into competing teams, each of which will need to [satisfy the game requirements](en/requirements) and thus will need a mobile device and a Telegram account.
(And each team will also need some basic *coding* knowledge in order to solve the puzzles!)

The game is based around the following simple activities:
scanning square barcodes (known as ‚ÄúQR&nbsp;Codes‚Äù) that represent locations to reach,
solving *coding*-based puzzles,
and snapping some *selfies*.
The gameplay is described in further detail in the [game‚Äôs player guide](en/how-to-play).

Check out the short video below for an overview of the game from the player‚Äôs point of view:
