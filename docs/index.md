title: Code Hunting Games
---

*Code Hunting Games* are mixed-reality “treasure hunt” games in which teams of players compete against each other and solve coding puzzles through a Telegram bot.

## How does it work?

Game events can be freely organized by anybody and only require a Telegram account, a smartphone, a QR&nbsp;Code scanner, and a set of printable QR&nbsp;Codes that are generated by our bot after a simple game creation process.

Any number of player teams can participate: they also require at least one smartphone to interact with the bot and some basic coding skills!

Check out the video below for an overview of the game from the player’s point of view.
