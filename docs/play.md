# Required devices

There are a few requirements to be able to play the code hunting games, and they should all be procured before hand (you might need to dowload some applications, so a Wi-Fi connection is preferred for this step):
* A smarphone
* Telegram Messenger
* QR Code scanner
* Internet connection

## Smartphone

Any smartphone that has a camera and can use the Telegram messenger is good. Known supported operating systems are: 
* iOS
* Android 
* Windows Phone

## Telegram
Telegram is a free instant messenger that can be found on the [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807?mt=8), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger) or [Microfoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/store/p/telegram-messenger/9wzdncrdzhs0).

To use Telegram you will have to log in with an account, if you already have one, or sign in with a new account. You will also have to provide your phone number to activate Telegram on your device.
This messenger service will be used also to follow the code hunting games on the public channels, so even if you're not the team captain you can still follow the game progress.

## QR Code scanner

A QR Code scanner is a barcode scanner that can recognize the square barcodes that are used in this game. 

There are many QR Code scanners on the various app marketplaces, so we will suggest the ones that work best:

* Android: [Barcode Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android)
* iOS: [QR Code Barcode](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/qrcode-barcode/id811899990?l=en&mt=8) OR if you have iOS 11 just open your camera and scan! The barcode scanner is integrated into the front camera
* Windows Phone: [QR Scanner - Rapid Scan](https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/store/p/qr-scanner-rapid-scan/9nblggh08m95?rtc=1)

## Internet connection

The game uses a bot on Telegram to communicate instructions and information to the players, and this requires an active internet connection.

If the area of the game is completely covered by Wi-Fi, well, you're covered! Otherwise please keep your internet connection active to correctly participate in the game.

Another suggestion is to also have your location on: since it's a treasure hunt, and you have to reach certain geographical locations, the device's navigator might give you a hand.

# How to Play

Once you have all of the required instruments (Smartphone with Telegram, QR Code scanner and internet connection), you are ready to participate in the Code Hunting Games.

During the game you will be repeating the following actions: scanning a QR Code, answering a bot on telegram, taking a selfie.
 
The game will begin with the scan of a QR Code that the organizers have placed at the starting location of the event. So open your QR Code scanner app, scan the QR Code and see Telegram open. The Code Hunting Bot will now ask you to solve a first puzzle. 

Once you have solved the puzzle, send the answer to the Code Hunting Bot on Telegram.
