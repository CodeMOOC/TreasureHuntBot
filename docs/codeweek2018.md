<p class="lead">
Are you ready to organize a Code Hunting Game for Code&nbsp;Week&nbsp;2018?
</p>

Great!
Let's bring this year's Code&nbsp;Week to the next level together: join the *glocal* Code Hunting Game on **20th October, from 11:00 to 13:00 CEST**.
In that timeframe, all registered game sessions will take place simultaneously across Europe.
[Last year's event](http://blog.codeweek.eu/post/166975540609/the-codehunting-game-more-than-1000-people) was played by more than 1000&nbsp;total participants over 22&nbsp;local games, all competing against each other to reach the final prize.&nbsp;üèÜ

To join the glocal event with your local game session, create a new game by scanning the following code:

    </a>
</div>

The game creation process and the rules for players are exactly like in standard ‚Äúfree to play‚Äù Code Hunting Games, except that games all start at 11:00 on 20th October.
Check out the [game creator guide](/en/game-creation) if you need help.
We also prepared a special [Code&nbsp;Week game creator guide](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/codeweek-s3/docs/CodeWeek+2018+Code+Hunting+Games+guide.pdf)&nbsp;(PDF) you may find helpful.

If you join the event, do not forget to [pin your event on the Code&nbsp;Week map](https://codeweek.eu/events)!&nbsp;üó∫
